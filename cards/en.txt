Refactor before you regret.
Beware the global state.
Code is a mirror of your mind.
The best feature is the one you remove.
Silence your linter, not your conscience.
Every TODO is a whisper from the future.
Tests are the dreams of stable code.
Modularity is clarity in disguise.
A bug is just misunderstood logic.
Your code reflects your current mindset.
Write code as if your future self will read it.
Every bug is an invitation to understanding.
Architecture is born not from diagrams, but from intent.
Deletion is a form of care.
Tests are trust expressed in code.
A module is an island, but not a loner.
Comments are traces of thought, not excuses.
Complexity is noise; clarity is music.
Each commit is the breath of the project.
Fear rewriting less than leaving doubt.
A feature without meaning is just noise.
Global state is a shadow hard to trace.
Renaming is an act of reflection.
The linter is not an enemy, but a mirror.
Encapsulation is care for the future.
A bug is not a mistake, but a challenge.
Documentation is an invitation to dialogue.
A framework is a costume, not your skin.
Code without context is a phrase without tone.
Every if is a choice.
Complexity grows where meaning fades.
A pattern is not law, but suggestion.
Don't optimize what doesn't work.
A feature without tests is a bridge without supports.
Each commit is a snapshot of your state.
Don't write code you're afraid to read.
Architecture is not a diagram, it's a mindset.
Comments are footprints of thought.
Fear not deletion — fear unnecessary survival.
Each return is an exit from an idea.
A nameless function is a thought without meaning.
State is memory, not garbage.
Each try is hope.
Each catch is acceptance.
Logic is not order, but a path.
Each switch is a fork in the road.
Each loop is a repetition of fate.
Each import is an invitation.
Each export is a farewell.
Each null is emptiness to be understood.
Each true is affirmation.
Each false is doubt.
Each break is refusal.
Each continue is persistence.
Each throw is a cry.
Each await is patience.
Each async is trust.
Each bug is a mirror.
Each fix is healing.
Each pull is a request.
Each push is a statement.
Each merge is compromise.
Each fork is a path chosen.
Each issue is a voice.
Each PR is a proposal.
Each review is a second look.
Each approve is recognition.
Each reject is a challenge.
Each release is a birth.
Each rollback is regret.
Each tag is a name.
Each branch is a possibility.
Each main is a foundation.
Each README is an invitation.
Each LICENSE is freedom.
Each .gitignore is a boundary.
Each config is intention.
Each log is memory.
Each test is trust.
Each fail is a lesson.
Each pass is confirmation.
Each build is form.
Each deploy is a step into the world.
Each crash is awakening.
Each restart is a chance.
Each timeout is waiting.
Each retry is hope.
Each status is a signal.
Each ping is a question.
Each pong is an answer.
Each CLI is the developer’s voice.
Each API is an agreement.
Each UI is an invitation.
Each UX is care.
Each pixel is a decision.
Each commit message is a story.
Each TODO is a reminder.
Each FIXME is an admission.
Each HACK is a compromise.
Each NOTE is a reflection.
Each CODE is you.
